# **🎨 WallpaperDownloader**

**WallpaperDownloader** is a simple tool that lets you download wallpapers from the **Steam Workshop (Wallpaper Engine)** and use them as live wallpapers with [Lively Wallpaper](https://www.rocksdanister.com/lively/).

## **✨ Features**

* 🎬 Download any wallpaper from Wallpaper Engine’s Steam Workshop using its share link

* 📂 Automatically organizes wallpapers into folders

* 🎥 Exports wallpapers as video files (.mp4) for compatibility

* 🖥️ Works with Lively Wallpaper to set them as desktop live wallpapers

* ⚡ Easy-to-use interface with no coding knowledge required

## **📥 Installation**

* Go to the Releases section of this repository.

* Download the latest version of WallpaperDownloader.zip.

* Extract the .zip file to a folder of your choice.

* Run WallpaperDownloader.exe.

* 👉 Download and install Lively Wallpaper
 from the Microsoft Store (required to set wallpapers).

Restart your computer once downloaded if the wallpapers are not working

* ⚠️ You do not need to install Python or Tkinter — the .exe is standalone.

## **🚀 Usage**

* Run WallpaperDownloader.exe.

* If prompted, select the DepotDownloaderMod.exe file manually.

* Choose a folder where wallpapers will be saved.

* Open Steam → Wallpaper Engine → Workshop or just click here to open [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=431960&browsesort=trend&section=readytouseitems&requiredtags%5B0%5D=Everyone&created_date_range_filter_start=0&created_date_range_filter_end=0&updated_date_range_filter_start=0&updated_date_range_filter_end=0&actualsort=trend&p=1&days=-1).

* Use the age filter set to “Everyone” to avoid explicit content.

* Pick that Wallpaper that is only Videe Type because right now the Audio reponsive Wallpapers are not working (will definitely make it work in some time)

* Copy the wallpaper’s share link (example: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884323042).

* Paste the link(s) into the Workshop Links Box in the app (multiple links allowed, one per line).

* Click Download → Wallpapers will be saved as .mp4 files.

* Open Lively Wallpaper → click the “+” icon → import the downloaded video file.

* Apply it as your desktop live wallpaper.

## **Fixing error**

If the console shows: Unable to login to Steam3:AlreadyLoggedInElsewhere
Then just change the account from ruiiixx to any other account and press download, if it shows error again then change it back to ruiiixx and it should work now
